Turf Town, Playo, and similar companies, here’s a scenario:

My friends were debating which turf was the closest to the entire group - a common dilemma many groups face.

Here’s a way to make it quicker & easier for them:

What if you could simply offer one or many turfs that are closest to the group, minimizing the total distance traveled while also considering user preferences?

Here’s a prototype implementation complete with documentation.

Features:
- Outlier discounting ensures the best Turf suggestion works for the majority, reducing travel frustration. Thanks to diminishing sensitivity of distance, we can exclude far-away users from the turf searching step.
- Distance metric. Haversine distance considers the curvature of the Earth's surface. Real-time distance & time from maps could be incorporated into the genetic algorithm.

This feature could help platforms like Playo increase group bookings by reducing friction and simplifying user experience.

What do you think about this? Feel free to contribute to this project by building on it, or sharing your views :D
